# Plant Classification - Optimization Project

![Plant Classification](plant_classification.jpg)

This repository hosts a plant classification project, specifically the differentiation between diseased and healthy tomato plants. The primary goal is to prevent the spread of diseases and detect them at an early stage.

## Objective

The main purpose of this project is to develop a plant classification system that distinguishes between diseased and healthy tomato plants. This is crucial to prevent disease spread and ensure crop health.

## Possible Future Advancements

This project has the potential to expand and evolve in the future. A promising application would be using images captured by drones for large-scale plantation analysis and early disease detection.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease) and focuses on plant disease classification. Specifically, we extracted the classes "tomato__Early_blight" and "tomato__healthy" for our analysis.
